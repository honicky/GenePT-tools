      "Gene Symbol BRCA1 This gene encodes a 190 kD nuclear phosphoprotein that plays a role in maintaining genomic stability, and it also acts as a tumor suppressor. The BRCA1 gene contains 22 exons spanning about 110 kb of DNA. The encoded protein combines with other tumor suppressors, DNA damage sensors, and signal transducers to form a large multi-subunit protein complex known as the BRCA1-associated genome surveillance complex (BASC). This gene product associates with RNA polymerase II, and through the C-terminal domain, also interacts with histone deacetylase complexes. This protein thus plays a role in transcription, DNA repair of double-stranded breaks, and recombination. Mutations in this gene are responsible for approximately 40% of inherited breast cancers and more than 80% of inherited breast and ovarian cancers. Alternative splicing plays a role in modulating the subcellular localization and physiological function of this gene. Many alternatively spliced transcript variants, some of which are disease-associated mutations, have been described for this gene, but the full-length natures of only some of these variants has been described. A related pseudogene, which is also located on chromosome 17, has been identified. Protein summary: E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that specifically mediates the formation of 'Lys-6'-linked polyubiquitin chains and plays a central role in DNA repair by facilitating cellular responses to DNA damage. It is unclear whether it also mediates the formation of other types of polyubiquitin chains. The BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer coordinates a diverse range of cellular pathways such as DNA damage repair, ubiquitination and transcriptional regulation to maintain genomic stability. Regulates centrosomal microtubule nucleation. Required for appropriate cell cycle arrests after ionizing irradiation in both the S-phase and the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Required for FANCD2 targeting to sites of DNA damage. Inhibits lipid synthesis by binding to inactive phosphorylated ACACA and preventing its dephosphorylation. Contributes to homologous recombination repair (HRR) via its direct interaction with PALB2, fine-tunes recombinational repair partly through its modulatory role in the PALB2-dependent loading of BRCA2-RAD51 repair machinery at DNA breaks. Component of the BRCA1-RBBP8 complex which regulates CHEK1 activation and controls cell cycle G2/M checkpoints on DNA damage via BRCA1-mediated ubiquitination of RBBP8.

      "Gene Symbol PRDM9 The protein encoded by this gene is a zinc finger protein with histone methyltransferase activity that catalyzes histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) during meiotic prophase. This protein contains multiple domains, including a Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) domain, an SSX repression domain (SSXRD), a PRD1-BF1 and RIZ homologous region, a subclass of SET (PR/SET) domain, and a tandem array of C2H2 zinc fingers. The zinc finger array recognizes a short sequence motif, leading to local H3K4me3, and meiotic recombination hotspot activity. The observed allelic variation alters the DNA-binding sequence specificity of the protein, resulting in distinct meiotic recombination hotspots amongst individuals and populations. Multiple alternate alleles of this gene have been described. Protein summary: Histone methyltransferase that sequentially mono-, di-, and tri-methylates both 'Lys-4' (H3K4) and 'Lys-36' (H3K36) of histone H3 to produce respectively trimethylated 'Lys-4' (H3K4me3) and trimethylated 'Lys-36' (H3K36me3) histone H3 and plays a key role in meiotic prophase by determining hotspot localization thereby promoting meiotic recombination. Can also methylate all four core histones with H3 being the best substrate and the most highly modified. Is also able, on one hand, to mono and di-methylate H4K20 and on other hand to trimethylate H3K9 with the di-methylated H3K9 as the best substrate (By similarity). During meiotic prophase, binds specific DNA sequences through its zinc finger domains thereby determining hotspot localization where it promotes local H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 enrichment on the same nucleosomes through its histone methyltransferase activity. Thereby promotes double-stranded breaks (DSB) formation, at this subset of PRDM9-binding sites, that initiates meiotic recombination for the proper meiotic progression (By similarity). During meiotic progression hotspot-bound PRDM9 interacts with several complexes; in early leptonema binds CDYL and EHMT2 followed by EWSR1 and CXXC1 by the end of leptonema. EWSR1 joins PRDM9 with the chromosomal axis through REC8 (By similarity). In this way, controls the DSB repair pathway, pairing of homologous chromosomes and sex body formation (By similarity). Moreover plays a central role in the transcriptional activation of genes during early meiotic prophase thanks to H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 enrichment that represents a specific tag for epigenetic transcriptional activation (By similarity). In addition performs automethylation (By similarity). Acetylation and phosphorylation of histone H3 attenuate or prevent histone H3 methylation (By similarity).\n",

      "   - PRDM9 is primarily expressed in germ cells, particularly during meiosis. It is also expressed in various tissues, but specific cell types beyond germ cells are not extensively documented.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Drug or Drug Classes**: \n",
      "   - There is limited information on specific drugs or drug classes that directly interact with PRDM9. However, general inhibitors of histone methyltransferases may affect its activity, but specific interactions are not well characterized.\n",

      "4. **Pathways and Biological Processes**: \n",
      "   - PRDM9 is involved in several biological processes, including:\n",
      "     - Meiotic recombination\n",
      "     - Regulation of gene expression during meiosis\n",
      "     - Histone methylation (specifically H3K4 and H3K36)\n",
      "     - Double-stranded break formation in DNA\n",
      "     - Chromosome pairing and sex body formation during meiosis\n",

Predicted to be active in central element; male germ cell nucleus; and transverse filament. Protein summary: Major component of the transverse filaments of synaptonemal complexes, formed between homologous chromosomes during meiotic prophase. Required for normal assembly of the central element of the synaptonemal complexes. Required for normal centromere pairing during meiosis. Required for normal meiotic chromosome synapsis during oocyte and spermatocyte development and for normal male and female fertility.\\n    \\n    ### SYCP1 Gene Overview\\n\\n**Gene Symbol:** SYCP1  \\n**Function:** SYCP1 encodes a protein that is a major component of the transverse filaments of the synaptonemal complex, which is vital for meiosis. It is involved in double-stranded DNA binding and protein homotetramerization and plays a critical role in the assembly of the central element of synaptonemal complexes, centromere pairing, and meiotic chromosome synapsis.\\n\\n#### 1. Associated Genes\\n- **SYCP2**: Contributes to synaptonemal complex assembly.\\n- **SYCP3**: Another critical component of the synaptonemal complex.\\n- **RAD51**: Involved in DNA repair and homologous recombination, mediating interactions with SYCP1 during meiosis.\\n\\n#### 2. Cell Types or Classes of Expression\\n- **Germ Cells**: Expressed predominantly in male and female germ cells, specifically in oocytes and spermatocytes during meiotic prophase.\\n- **Testicular Cells**: Expression noted in the testis, particularly in developing spermatocytes.\\n\\n#### 3. Drug Interactions\\n- Currently, there is no specific information available regarding drugs or drug classes that interact directly with the SYCP1 gene or its protein product.\\n\\n#### 4. Pathways and Biological Processes\\n- **Meiosis**: Key role in meiotic prophase and chromosome synapsis.\\n- **Centromere Dynamics**: Involvement in the correct pairing of centromeres during meiosis.\\n- **Recombination**: Participation in homologous recombination processes through interaction with proteins necessary for DNA repair.\\n\\nThis summary consolidates key information regarding the SYCP1 gene, its functions, associations, and roles in biological processes. Additional, specific data may require in-depth studies or exploration of updated resources.\\n    ',\n",
